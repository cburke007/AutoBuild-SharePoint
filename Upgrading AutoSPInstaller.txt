!!DO NOT overwrite \AutoSPInstaller\AutoSPInstallerFunctionsCustom.ps1!! - This contains some custom functions for Rackspace specific script requirements

Overwrite everything else

Delete the AutoSPInstallerInput.XML file. This gets built from the Rackspace wrapper scripts based off of the Default_AutoSPinstallerInput.XML file

Edit AutoSPInstallerMain.ps1 and add the following to around line 86
# Configure Rackspace Specific Pre-Requisites
Set-RSPreReqs

The resulting change in code should look like the following:

#Region External Functions
. "$env:dp0\AutoSPInstallerFunctions.ps1"
. "$env:dp0\AutoSPInstallerFunctionsCustom.ps1"
#EndRegion

# Configure Rackspace Specific Pre-Requisites
Set-RSPreReqs

#Region Remote Install
Function Install-Remote
{


For AutoSPInstallerGUI - Overwrite both AutoSPinstallerGUI.exe and Prerequisite Check.exe (only two files in the downloaded zip)
